# DFIR Projects

This section contains digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) case studies derived from academic and independent investigations, designed to demonstrate practical forensic methodology, analytical reasoning, and professional reporting.

Focus areas include:
- Disk and USB forensic investigations
- Live response, memory, and process analysis
- Timeline reconstruction and artifact correlation
- Evidence handling and integrity validation

## Projects

### 🔹 Host-Based Process and Network Analysis
**Type:** Live Response / Host-Based DFIR  
**Focus Areas:** Process enumeration, network connection analysis, PID correlation, executable validation  

Live host forensic investigation analyzing running processes, active TCP/UDP connections, and executable legitimacy using cryptographic hashing and threat intelligence to identify suspicious activity and assess escalation requirements.

### 🔹 USB Forensic Investigation and Incident Response
**Type:** Disk & USB Forensics / Incident Response  
**Focus Areas:** Evidence acquisition, artifact analysis, timeline reconstruction, integrity validation  

Forensic examination of a removable USB device supporting an incident response scenario, emphasizing forensic soundness, malware identification, evidence validation, and user attribution.

### 🔹 Disk & File System Forensic Analysis (NTFS)
**Type:** Disk Forensics / File System Analysis  
**Focus Areas:** NTFS artifact analysis, metadata interpretation, evidence integrity, forensic reporting  

In-depth forensic analysis of an NTFS file system focused on identifying and interpreting file system artifacts, validating evidence integrity through cryptographic hashing, and producing structured, recruiter-ready forensic documentation.
